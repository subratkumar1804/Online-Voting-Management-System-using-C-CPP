The project Online Voting System Consist of collecting vote, Showing result of each vote for each candidate, Leading Candidate, and exiting via giving a key value.

In "Cast the vote" section print all the candidate name and choice option to cast the vote.

In "Find Vote Count" section we will get the total number of vote casted in every candidate. If any one cast a vote to "None of these" Then this vote consider as spoiled vote.

And using "Find Leading Candidate" we got the result who is in the leading position. If any two candidate have the same highest vote then we got a error "Warning !!! No-win situation"

The code has been implemented using C++.
